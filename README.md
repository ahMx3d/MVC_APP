# MVC_APP
This app is an implementation for the concept of **MVC** just with ***registeration & login pages***.
It's been implemented using **HTML, Bootstrap, and font awesome icons** for the front-end and **PHP, and MySQL** the back-end.
There are **.htaccess** files that have **indexes** to ***prevent any access to the application folders*** except through (http://localhost/phpdev/mvc/public) which adds some how kind of **security**, and also **passwords are hashed** before stored in the Database. Note that there are some **validations constraints** while registering; if these validations are not achieved there are **error messages** would pop up **down of each invalid input** and the input's **borders** itself becomes **red** with a **wrong sign**, and all the **inputs are sanitized** before inserting them to the Database.
